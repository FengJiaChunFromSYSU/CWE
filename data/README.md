# Data

## analogy

`analogy.txt` is the analogical reasoning dataset on Chinese.


## wordsim
`240.txt` and `297.txt` are `wordsim-240` and `wordsim-296` respectively. 

Word pair `OPEC	石油` in `297.txt` is removed in the test.

These two datasets are conventional similarity test for Chinese. These files are uploaded for convenience and they are NOT created by the authors of the paper. However, it is hard to find the source. I will be willing to accept any suggestion about refining the reference. 

Wordsim-296 is from **SemEval-2012 task 4: evaluating Chinese word similarity**. [(Abstract)](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task4.html) [(pdf)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2387695)

## Non-compositional wordlist
The wordlist is uploaded as `non-composition.txt`.
